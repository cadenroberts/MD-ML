## Single Chain Protein Dataset

This directory contains the files I used to build a single chain protein dataset. These pdbs contain no ligands, no ions, and should have no gaps (though that required a bit of cleanup).

The initial list of PDBs was generated using is query to RCSB:
```
Total Number of Non-polymer Instances = 0
AND Total Number of Polymer Instances (Chains) = 1
AND Number of Distinct Protein Entities = 1
AND Number of Unmodeled Polymer Residues per Assembly = 0
AND Deposited Model Count = 1
AND Number of Polymer Instances (Chains) per Assembly = 1
AND Refinement Resolution <= 2.5
```

The filtered list of PDBs can then be generated by running:
```
python3 download.py
python3 analyze.py
python3 analyze_seq.py
```

The `analyze_seq.py` script also requires the `levenshtein` module to calculate sequence similarity:
```
pip install levenshtein
```

Final cleanup involved some manual steps, which are found in `gap_check.ipynb` and `single_chain_pdb_selection.ipynb`

To generate the thumbnail file in `single_chain_pdb_selection.ipynb` you'll also need to run `download_images.py` first.
